## 📖 Overview

This repository contains two distinct starter projects focused on interactivity and education:

1.  **Math Graphics**: A project dedicated to visualizing concepts from Python's built-in `math` library. See mathematical functions come to life through graphical demonstrations.
2.  **Custom CMD**: A self-written command-line interface (CMD) environment. This project has its own internal structure and serves as a foundation for building text-based interactive tools.

The core philosophy is **"Interactivity is everything!"** – learning and experimentation are driven by direct, visual, and textual engagement.

## ✨ Features

*   **Interactive Math Visualizations**: Explore mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithms, constants, etc.) not just by calculating, but by seeing them plotted or animated.
*   **Custom Command-Line Environment**: A structured, self-made CMD application. Its multi-folder architecture makes it a great example for learning how to build larger text-based interfaces.
*   **Python-Focused**: Built primarily with Python, utilizing its standard library and, where necessary, external packages managed via `requirements.txt`.
*   **Simple Execution**: Both projects are designed to be run from a single main entry point for ease of use.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the projects up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   **Git**: To clone the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prepodobniy-wq/Starter_Projects.git
    cd Starter_Projects
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate it:
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    The required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: The math project relies mainly on built-in libraries, while the custom CMD might have external dependencies listed here.)*

---

## 🎮 Usage

Each project has its own main file. To run one, simply execute its main script from the root directory.

### Running the Math Graphics Demo
```bash
python Graphic_tests/fade.py
(Replace `fade.py` with the specific demo you want to run.)

bash
python myCMD/main.py

* Built with python

Python Standard Library - Including math, tkinter (or similar for graphics), and modules for building the CMD.

External Packages - Managed via requirements.txt for any additional functionality.

```

### 🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new math visualizations, additional commands for the CMD, or bug fixes, feel free to:

Fork the project.

```bash

Create your feature branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature).

Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature').

Push to the branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature).

Open a Pull Request.
